                <h3>Steve jobs</h3>
                <p>What impact has steve Jobs had on my life? Ever short story i've written as an adult(and certainly
                    every one that has been published), almost every email i've ever written, has been written on
                    machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before i ever encountered
                    a PC Steve jobs helped to realise the Star Trek future i dreamed of as a kid And through his vision,
                    I have been able to realise my own.You'll be missed, Mr jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work</p>

                <p>Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company, I cant find words how to describe my feelings. For me Apple
                    means a lot . I got a good job using Apple products. I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple,
                    and of course i've been always admiring your products. and for me everything in Apple is connected
                    to Steve. I do hope he will be remembered around the world as a
                    genius</p>
